Q2.c Bar chart comaparing the mean glucose and max glucose: sample vs population:

This graph compares glucose statistics between a sample and the overall population using two side-by-side bar charts. The left chart shows that the sample mean and population mean glucose levels are nearly identical, suggesting the sample is representative. The right one compares the maximum glucose values, which also appear very close between the sample and population. Both charts use consistent color coding to distinguish sample (blue) from population (orange). 

Glucose distribution: population vs sample:

This graph shows the glucose distribution of a population compared to a sample of 25 individuals. Both curves are centered around similar glucose values, indicating that the sample reflects the population’s central tendency. The population curve is smoother and more stable, while the sample curve is slightly more jagged due to its smaller size. This visual highlights how sample distributions can approximate population distributions but may show more variability.

BMI 98th percentile: sample vs population chart:

This graph compares the Body Mass Index (BMI) distributions of a population and a sample focusing on their 98th percentile values. The solid blue and light blue curves show that both distributions are similarly shaped and centered It indicates the sample reflects the population well. The red dashed line marks the population’s 98th percentile BMI, while the blue dashed line marks the sample’s 98th percentile. These vertical lines are close together suggesting the sample accurately captures the high-end BMI threshold of the population.

Boostrap of the mean, std dev, and 98th percentile:

This figure presents three histograms showing the distribution of bootstrap estimates from 500 samples of size 150. The first histogram illustrates how the sample means cluster tightly around the population mean. It is marked by a red dashed line. The second histogram shows the spread of sample standard deviations which also center near the population value but with more variability. The third histogram displays the distribution of 98th percentile values which align closely with the population’s 98th percentile. Overall, we can say these plots demonstrate that bootstrapping can effectively estimate population statistics while revealing their sampling variability.
