Q1.a: I started my code by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure to identify missing values and data types. After that I created a copy of the data and applies imputation, using the mean for normally distributed columns and the median for skewed ones. Next, I cleaned numeric columns by stripping units and non-numeric characters, converting them into usable numerical formats. After cleaning, the code re-applies imputation to handle any new missing values introduced during conversion. Finally, I  dropped columns with more than 60% missing data to ensure the dataset remains reliable for analysis.
